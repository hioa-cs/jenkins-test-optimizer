no change in dependencies
just change in probability made huge changes in the no of swaps
and the tests which have been swapped.

though based on the other results in t10 i can see that tests which are
being swapped have a pattern, that might have something to do with the
dependencies.

also the swaps seem to be mostly after the 60th position or more .
is there a pattern to see there?
