 t3_min
 no change in dependencies
just change in probability made huge changes in the no of swaps
and the tests which have been swapped.

t10

though based on the other results in t10 i can see that tests which are
being swapped have a pattern, that might have something to do with the
dependencies.

also the swaps seem to be mostly after the 60th position or more .
is there a pattern to see there?


general note for other work based on case 4:

Since multiple iterations does lead to other swaps,
maybe sorting with another parameter such as the time taken to run a particular
test could provide some insight.

Discussion Note from Counselling:

- Tests that take short time to fail could be put to the front.
- Multiple iterations of the algorithm on the sorted test leads to a more optimal
list of tests.

How to analyse that?
