# jenkins-test-optimizer

The aim  of this project is to explore the boundaries of software test automation
in a continuous delivery pipeline by implementing a re-ordering algorithm 
to optimally sort the test cases such that tests with a higher likely hood of failing 
are executed first, thus enabling faster feedback for failed tests to developers.
